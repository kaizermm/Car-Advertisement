# Car-Advertisement
### Goal
The objective of this report is to analyze the impact of age, mileage, condition, and cylinder on the price of vehicles using data collected over the past few years. By examining these factors, we aim to gain insights into how each variable influences the pricing of vehicles.
### This project includes the following files:

- The project's final Jupyter notebook (EDA.ipynb) in notebooks;
- app.py to build the app
- vehicles_us.csv
